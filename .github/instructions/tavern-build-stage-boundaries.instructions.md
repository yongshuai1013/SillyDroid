# Tavern Build Stage Boundaries

- Treat the contract block at the top of the target script as authoritative.
- `scripts/resolve-tavern-build-plan.sh` computes versions, changed flags, release naming, and canonical output paths only.
- `scripts/build-tavern-android-runtime-image.sh` is stage 1 only and may output only runtime image/rootfs artifacts.
- `scripts/build-tavern-dependency-packs.sh` is stage 2 only and may output only dependency pack archives/manifests.
- `scripts/sync-tavern-android-bootstrap.sh` is stage 3 only and may output only `server-source.zip` plus its manifest.
- `scripts/build-tavern-android-apk.sh` is stage 4 only and is the only script allowed to compose the final `server-payload`.
- `scripts/build-tavern-android-local.sh` is the normal one-click local entrypoint and must orchestrate the same stages and paths as CI instead of reimplementing them.
- If a request changes stage boundaries, update the relevant script contract header and the README four-stage-boundary section in the same change.
